Heapsort, merge sort, quicksort

heapsort: in place but not stable, 
merge sort is stable but not in place 
quicksort runs O(N^2) worst time

An in place sort is one that uses O(1) space,
 stable is where the entries which are equal appear in their original place. 

for entries less than 10, insertion sort is superior, 

if k elements away, min heap, 
if small number of keys, counting sort; counting elements less than it,
BST (store equal elements in linked list), and in order traversal,  

radix sort: numerical attreibutes
