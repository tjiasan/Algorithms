BST augmentations:

Node {
    height
    size: 
}


size makes it easy to know elements less than k;

e.g.
     A(40)
    /   \ 
  B(7)  C(20)

  if want to lookup something in C subtree,

  Add size from B(7) + 1(A)

  And recurse C with size


  if want to know elements between range A to B
  find elements less than B and elements less than A

  B -A is the answer
